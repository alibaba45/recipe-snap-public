- Create `actionLogUtils.js` with `createAuditLog` helper for logging admin actions to Firestore.

feat: Implement Admin User Designation via Firebase Custom Claims
- Added Firebase Cloud Function (`processAdminClaimRequest`) triggered by Firestore writes to `adminClaimRequests` collection to set/remove `admin:true` custom claims on users.

- Upgraded Firebase project to Blaze plan to support Cloud Function deployment.
- Updated `AuthContext` to read custom claims from user ID tokens and expose an `isAdmin` boolean state.
- Modified `AppHeader` to display an "Admin" title variant and a conditional admin panel icon/link for users with the `admin:true` claim.
- Iteratively debugged and resolved Cloud Function deployment errors, including ESLint issues, SDK syntax errors for v2 Firestore triggers, and Eventarc permission propagation delays.
